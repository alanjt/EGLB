# EGLB

This package contains models of EGLB/Brooklands  pre war (aprox 1930) and post war (aprox 1970)


Installation

Make a directories for your local scenery. On my system these is C:\Flightgear\EGLB and C:\Flightgear\EGLBPreWar.

Copy all files and directories from the either the pre war or the post war EGLB directory into this local scenery directory. You should now have a directories C:\Flightgear\EGLB\Airports, C:\Flightgear\EGLB\Models, C:\Flightgear\LB\Objects, C:\Flightgear\EGLB\Terrain -- and a similar set foe EGLBPreWar.

Add the local scenery directory to your Flightgear start options  e.g. :-
 
 --fg-scenery=C:\FlightGear\EGLB
 
Both pre war and post war versions of this airfield share the same identification and geographical space. Take care that only one of them is referenced in the Flightgear scenery path.
